Blockusign Tokenomics (Very Early Work/Idea in Progress)
====================

Inspiration article

1. Use the app for free for X months or for X number of documents signed.
2. By the time you sign over X documents to keep using the platform you must buy 1 Blockusign (Tokenomics !?!?)
3. Early adopter will be insentivised to use the app more, sign more docs, and tell their friends about it, because they basically own a part of the Blockusign network now. (Network Effects !?!?) 

Users get a free product for typical use cases (for example signing 5 documents a week). More advanced users will need to buy a token to keep using the tool after X amounts of documents signed.  Therefore after buying a token you have stake in the network which will unlock the User to sign X more documents. When they have a vested interest in using a great product it will fund the developers to continouly iterate and create a better product. The more tokens a user aquires the better the product will become for them.

Total Supply Distributions
==========================

Continuous Development = 25% (maybe less, TODO what are other projects using)

User (mining Rewards (every time you sign a doc, you also "mine") , Networks Effect) = 75%


# Proof of Signing Mining
X number of docs signed per day will mine out X amount of tokens.

# Scare Resources
- Humans using the app and signing docs
- developers time and knowledge contributing code

# Prevent Spam
- we don't want one user signing a million docs in one day spamming the network [unless they own alot of tokens]

Alternate Funding Models
========================
- Monthly subscriptions
- Pay per sign
- Free with pay for advanced features
- Donations
- Blockstacks App Rewards Mining
